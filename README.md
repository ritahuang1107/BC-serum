# Code and Software statement

## BBT-BC-Serum sample-Prediction-Model

### System requirements

The following package / library versions were used in this study:  

python (version 3.9.18)

joblib (version  1.2.0)   
numpy (version 1.26.0)   
scikit-learn (version 1.2.1)   
pandas (version  1.4.3)  

### Additional information
This is a Medical Prediction Model which can be used to predict the benignity or malignancy of the breast tumor patients through their serum.


## WGCNA

Weighted Correlation Network Analysis

### System requirements

The following package / library versions were used in this study:

R (version 4.2.3)  
WGCNA (version 1.72-1)  

### Additional information
This package could be useful for  finding the relationship between breast tumor patients clinical characteristics and functional genes through rudimentary data cleaning, construction of correlation networks, module identification, summarization, and relating of variables and modules to sample traits.


## Mfuzz

Soft clustering of time series gene expression data

### System requirements

The following package / library versions were used in this study:

R (version 4.2.3)  
Mfuzz (version 2.60.0)  

### Additional information

This function is a wrapper function for cmeans of the e1071 package. It performs soft clustering of genes based on their expression values using the fuzzy c-means algorithm.
The time-series' trait of breast cancer progression could be identified with this package.
